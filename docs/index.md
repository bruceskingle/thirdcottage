# Cottage Industry for the Third Millenium
Third Cottage is a social enterprise for the post-Covid world.
Our products are designed for the new workplace, where people work from home much of the time
and our production methods are structured so that as much of the work as possible can be
performed by artisans working from a home workshop.
While machine tools are used in our production processes where they make sense, 
and our designs are supported by Computer Aided Design (CAD),
our products are made largely by hand and customised so that every piece is unique.

## Made to Measure, Bespoke Workspace Furniture
Many people now find themselves working from home for much of the time, and while functional
office furniture following modern design practices is a necessity, space is often at a 
premium and workplace needs must be balenced with the practicalities and asthetics of home life.

Off the shelf office furniture often doesn't fit into a home in terms of style or the physical space.
That small gap between the wall and the edge of a desk is not just an eye sore, it's a daily
practical irritation and a waste of prescious space. Third cottage designs are flexible and
dimensions can be adjusted to fit your space, your life style and your body, perfectly.

When fitting out an office, space planners must consider everyone, in some cases designing
around atypical users. For example, the UK government's Health and Safety Executive says
(in
[Reducing Awkward Postures]
(https://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/uld/art/posture.htm))

_Tables should accommodate the largest users.
Platforms, adjustable chairs and footrests can be used by smaller users to achieve optimal
working height._

When choosing workspace furniture for your home, Third Cottage funiture can provide an exact fit,
for you, and your space.
