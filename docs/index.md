# Cottage Industry for the Third Millenium
Third Cottage is a social enterprise for the post-Covid world.
Our products are designed for the new workplace, where people work from home much of the time
and our production methods are structured so that as much of the work as possible can be
performed by artisans working from a home workshop.
While machine tools are used in our production where they make sense, 
and our designs are supported by moden CAD processes,
our products are made largely by hand and customised so that every piece is unique.

## Made to Measure, Bespoke Workspace Furniture
Many people now find themselves working from home for much of the time, and while functional
office furniture following modern design practices is a necessity, space is often at a 
premium and workplace needs must be balenced with leisure activities and domestic
practicality.
