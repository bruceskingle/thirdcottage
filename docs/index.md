# Cottage Industry for the Third Millenium
Third Cottage is a social enterprise for the post-Covid world.
Our products are designed for the new workplace, where people work from home much of the time
and our production methods are structured so that as much of the work as possible can be
performed by artisans working from a home workshop.
While machine tools are used in our production processes where they make sense, 
and our designs are supported by Computer Aided Design (CAD),
our products are made largely by hand and customised so that every piece is unique.

## Hand Made to Measure Solid Wood Furniture
All of our furniture is made from solid wood, no metal fixings (screws nails etc.) are used
except for hinges and joints where pieces can be disassembled or parts removed. All of our
designs can be made in a variety of different hard woods, like oak, iroko, walnut or maple.
You can choose the material which suits your taste and the existing decor of your home and
the sizes of all our designs can be adjusted to your needs.

## Customised Bespoke Workspace Furniture
Many people now find themselves working from home for much of the time, and while functional
office furniture following modern design practices is a necessity, space is often at a 
premium and workplace needs must be balenced with the practicalities and asthetics of home life.

Off the shelf office furniture often doesn't fit into a home in terms of style or the physical space.
That small gap between the wall and the edge of a desk is not just an eye sore, it's a daily
practical irritation and a waste of prescious space. Third cottage designs are flexible and
dimensions can be adjusted to fit your space, your life style and your body, perfectly.

When fitting out an office, space planners must consider everyone, in some cases designing
around atypical users. For example, the UK government's Health and Safety Executive says
(in
[Reducing Awkward Postures]
(https://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/uld/art/posture.htm)
)

_Tables should accommodate the largest users.
Platforms, adjustable chairs and footrests can be used by smaller users to achieve optimal
working height._

When choosing workspace furniture for your home, Third Cottage funiture can provide an exact fit,
for you, and your space.

## Our Process
To place an order, or discuss your specific requirements, send an email to sales@firstcottage.com
and we will give you a quote and delivery timeline. When your furniture is ready it will be
shipped to you in a custom made wooden crate to ensure that it reaches you in perfect condition
(you will need a screwdriver to open the crate).

Small pieces are shipped by UPS overnight, larger pieces may take slightly longer to deliver,
but UK Mainland shipping is included in all our prices.
