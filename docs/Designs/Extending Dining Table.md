# Extending Dining Table
The Extending Dining Table is a simple and elegant dining or meeting table,
with one or two extension leaves allowing it to accomodate extra people when needed
while reducing the amount of space taken at other times.

The standard table is based on a 600mm wide place setting while the compact model
uses a 500mm spacing. The standard height of the table top above the floor is
750mm but this can be adjusted to your requirements. The table frame can be supplied
permanently assembled for maximum strength, or with discrete bolts allowing for
occaisinal disassembly for moving or storage.
