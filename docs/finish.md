# Finish
Third Cottage furniture is made from solid hard wood and finished with 
Osmo Polyx Oil which protects the wood without creating a seal, which means the wood can still breathe.


## Cleaning up Spills
The finish will resist liquid spills, and even red wine should not leave a stain, but spills should
be mopped up with a paper towel immediately. Hot or cold drinks may cause a mark if left for a
long time and the use of coasters or mats is recommended.

## Regular Cleaning

For daily maintenance, cleaning with a dry duster will be sufficient. Stubbon marks can be removed
with a damp cloth.

## Renovation

Renovating, even partially, is quick and easy. Just clean and re-treat worn areas with a thin coat of
Osmo Polyx Oil for an invisible repair. For deeper stains and scratches, a light sanding of the
affected area may be required.
Once the stain or scratch has been removed, clean the area thoroughly to remove all traces
of sanding dust then re-oil the affected area for a seamless repair.
